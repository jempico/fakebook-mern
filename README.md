# This is a work in progress project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the UI for a full-stack app that I'm buidling with MERN Stack. The app will eventually consume a Rest API built from scratch with Express, MongoDB, OAuth.

## Stack
- React
- Material icons MUI
- Unsplash Image API


## Routes
So far the app has 2 routes:
- Home: http://localhost:3000/
- Login: http://localhost:3000/login


## Installation

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jempico/fakebook-mern.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Add environment variables: edit or create and `.env` file in the root directory with the following data: 
   ```
    REACT_APP_SECRET_KEY=ScsZ2UFeIFwwzsbF_cJuCmbpim9y7WdLO2nCI65coiQ
   ```
5. Run the app:
